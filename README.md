1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client for this project was Artemis Financial. They wanted to modernize their operations and use the most current security software. But at the top of the list was that they wanted Global Rains expertise about how to protect their clients data and financial data. 

2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I thought that I suppressed false positives pretty well. It is important to code securely so that PII will not be accessible to outside unauthorized entities. It adds peace of mind and confidence in their products. 

3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I thought it was difficult to actually read the vulnerablitiy reports. 

4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I added hash encryption and cert authentication. I would use the vulnerability report. 

5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ran the code and made sure that there were no errors once compiled. I conducted another vulnerability report and did analysis. 

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Using strong encryption algorithms seem to be the way to go moving forward. 

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show them that I have the ability to understand encryption code and how to conduct vulnerability reports, and how to anlyize the report for best possible next steps to secure the code.
